# Module 3 Challenge: Javascript Homework

This Homework assignment was completed for Unit Three of the U of M Bootcamp, to practice javascript work, namely with writing functions, variables, arrays, and objects. The complete code interacts with an html UI which allows user input on employee data to be displayed, with salaries averaged, in a table on the webpage.

## Instructions
File explained:
1. There is an event listener on the Add Employees button in html/UI 
  a. (which in turn is linked to the js via the first defined variable, addEmployeesButton).
2. Clicking it triggers the trackEmployeeData, which in turn:
  a. Declares a variable 'employees' which is tied to the collectEmployees variable function near the top of the js file (which will be filled out by me).
  b. Logs a table into the console, containing the employees collected by the collectEmployees variable function, 
  c. Calls the displayAverageSalary function near the top of the js file (which will be filled out by me).
  d. Logs a bar ASCII into the console.
  e. Calls the getRandomEmployee function near the top of the js file (which will be filled out by me).
  f. Sort method applied to 'employees' by 'lastname', which seems to need to be defined globally by me.
  g. Displays the employee data.
