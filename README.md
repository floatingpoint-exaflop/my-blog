# Module 4 Challenge: Javascript Web APIs

This Homework assignment was completed for Unit Four of the U of M Bootcamp, to practice javascript web APIs, using localStorage to hold sent and retrieved data between two connected html webpages. The complete code allows a user to give a username, title, and body text for blog posts, before submitting that data and seeing it on a blog page that holds multiple submissions via localStorage. Both pages feature a toggle feature for light/dark mode.
